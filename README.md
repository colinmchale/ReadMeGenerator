## Description  
This application was created to provide users a faster way to create a high-quality, professional ReadMe.  
 Developers can spend a lot of time making a ReadMe for each project from scratch, this is meant to save them time they could otherwise be using to code.  
With a provided template, the user can create a ReadMe by answering multiple prompts.  
This project taught me the importance of a well structured ReadMe to outline what the goal of the application is.
