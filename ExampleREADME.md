## Description  
This application was created to provide users a faster way to create a high-quality, professional ReadMe.  
 Developers can spend a lot of time making a ReadMe for each project from scratch, this is meant to save them time they could otherwise be using to code.  
 With a provided template, the user can create a ReadMe by answering multiple prompts.  
This project taught me the importance of a well structured ReadMe to outline what the goal of the application is.

The user will initialize the prompts by entering 'node index.js' in the command line. For each prompt, the user will have to submit either an answer or a pathway to a file. What the user submits will be rendered in the ReadMe.
